# Big-Data-Google-BigQuery-Project

This report will provide an overview of Google BigQuery, a fully-managed and cloud-based
interactive query service for massive datasets. We will provide an introduction to show how the
platform can be used, including how to create a database, how to load data into a database, and how
to perform queries in order to retrieve and modify useful information from a database. We hope to
cover the following steps in detail:

● Creating a database
● Adding tables to the database
● Loading data into a table
● Performing queries on a dataset
● Connecting to BigQuery with outside tools such as Python
